## About
- Backend-first mindset
- Interested in systems, performance, and stuff under the hood
- Automotive background influences how I think about engineering
- Always building something, even if it’s not public yet

I care more about **clean logic, reliability, and learning fast** than chasing buzzwords.

    These stats don’t mean everything. Private repos, offline projects, school/work code,
    and actual problem-solving don’t always show up here. Look at the work, not just the numbers.
