## About
Backend-first developer with an interest in systems, performance, and how things behave under real load.  
Automotive background shapes how I approach engineering: diagnose first, optimize second, ship when it’s solid.  
Always building something, even if it never makes it to a public repo.

**Languages:** Python, C/C++, Bash  
**Focus:** Backend architecture, networking, low-level concepts, automation  
**Interests:** Automotive engineering, performance tuning, breaking things to understand them

## Open to
Collaborations, challenging backend problems, and anything that forces me to learn something new.
